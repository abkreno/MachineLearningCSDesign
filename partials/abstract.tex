A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) with the All Different constraint forces every variable in the given satisfaction group to be different from the other variables. This problem is solvable using many different techniques, some of them are naive and others are more sophisticated techniques such as, the Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC) technique. Selecting an algorithm to solve the alldiff CSP is a hard decision to make. In this paper we discuss the usage of Algorithms Selection using Machine Learning to solve the alldiff CSP.
